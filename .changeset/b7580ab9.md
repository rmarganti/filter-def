Enforce non-null filter inputs for all filter types.

**Breaking change**: Filter inputs can no longer accept `null` or `undefined` values. The `CoreFilterInput` type now excludes these values, requiring explicit filter values. When a value can be nullable, prefer the `isNull` filter kind instead.

Refactored `CoreFilterInputMap` type to use a new `FieldTypeForFilter` helper, reducing type repetition and improving maintainability.

Added type tests for `CoreFilterInput` behavior via vitest.
