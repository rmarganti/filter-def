# TODO: Monorepo publishing requires additional setup.
# Consider using one of these approaches:
# - changesets (https://github.com/changesets/changesets)
# - multi-semantic-release (https://github.com/qiwi/multi-semantic-release)
# - semantic-release-monorepo plugin
#
# For now, this workflow is a placeholder that needs to be configured
# for proper multi-package versioning and publishing.
